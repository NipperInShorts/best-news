# Best News

Using NextJS, we source news from [NewsAPI Top Headlines](https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/top-headlines)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

## How to Use

Best News searches the top headlines.
You can choose a combination of searching top headlines by a search input, choosing a category, or choosing a region.

This will require an API key in you local env.
